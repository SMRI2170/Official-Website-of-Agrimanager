            <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 17, 2025</p>

            <p>Welcome to AgriManager. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Please read this privacy policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this privacy policy, please do not access the application.</p>

            <h2>Collection of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the App includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Personal Data:</strong> Personally identifiable information, such as your name or email address, that you voluntarily give to us when you register with the App. You are under no obligation to provide us with personal information of any kind; however, your refusal to do so may prevent you from using certain features of the App.</li>
                <li><strong>Data Entered into the App:</strong> We collect all data you voluntarily enter into the App, including but not limited to crop names, planting dates, task schedules, financial records, notes, and photos. This information is stored locally on your device and is not transmitted to our servers unless you explicitly use a backup or sync feature.</li>
                <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> Information such as your mobile device ID, model, and manufacturer, and information about the location of your device, if you permit us to access this information.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Use of Your Information</h2>
            <p>Having accurate information permits us to provide you with a smooth, efficient, and customized experience. Specifically, we may use information collected about you via the App to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Create and manage your account.</li>
                <li>Provide the core functionality of the App, such as tracking crops and tasks.</li>
                <li>Enable backup and restore features.</li>

                <li>Request feedback and contact you about your use of the App.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Disclosure of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any of your information with third parties for their promotional purposes.</p>
            <p>All data you enter is stored locally on your device. We do not have access to this data unless you use a cloud backup feature, in which case the data is securely transmitted and stored for the sole purpose of backup and restoration at your request.</p>

            <h2>Security of Your Information</h2>
            <p>We use administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information. While we have taken reasonable steps to secure the personal information you provide to us, please be aware that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse.</p>
